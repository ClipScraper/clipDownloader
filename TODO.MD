#################################### Bug:
- Using download url on a playlist like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD0Mm6WIcYs&list=RD0vb1CtGkqtw&index=3 downloads the entire playlist without adding the videos in the database
- Cancel to interrupt DL of videos doesn't work, it kept downloading the full playlist even after clicking Cancel
